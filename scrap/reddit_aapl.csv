THis despite 22% growth this last quarter compared to Apple's 33%, and Apple notched 100% growth the quarter before.  You could also add the fact TSLA now has  361 pe and no chance at all to grow more than 50% and then run into plenty of stiff competition. Yes I know Musk is a cult figure and the market plays favorites all the time. But over time, real earnings and stock prices are what matters.  AAPL is enduring the supply chain slowdown now, but who isn't?  MSFT and TSLA are as well, in fact the entire economy is. Plus unlike other companies, any lot sales for Apple this quarter simply get pushed ahead to the next one, so they really don't lose anything.  My point is that in terms of mega cap tech at least, AAPL is the only one which is undervalued and it appears to be undervalued by at least 25%.  Comments?"

Just curious about everyone’s opinion here:  what would it take for Apple stock to replicate its past 10 year growth in the next 10 years(eps, revenue, products, services, margins, acquisitions, partnerships, AI etc)?  Is that a shot to the moon or even remotely possible?  Is the only way if the Vision Pro or AR glasses become a household item like the iPhone? Is that why people are saying it’s not likely?"

Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett admitted selling a small part of its Apple stock in 2020 was a misstep. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Berkshire trimmed its Apple stake by just 3.7% to about 944 million shares.

“We got a chance to buy it and I sold some stock last year...that was probably a mistake,” said Buffett.

The “Oracle of Ohama” went on to to say that Apple’s stock is a “huge, huge bargain.” “It is indispensable to people,” Buffett said.

“The part it plays in their lives is huge,” he said. “A car costs $35,000 and I’m sure with some people if you asked them whether they wanted to give up, had to give up, their Apple, they’d give up their car.”

Apple is the largest position in Berkshire’s investment portfolio, in a bet worth nearly $111 billion.

So I decided to add a small FAQ which (I hope) would help you.

1. Q\_ Do I need to sell my shares to get this settlement? - No, if you have purchased during the class period, you are eligible.
2. Q\_ Who can claim this settlement? - ""All persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the publicly traded securities of Apple Inc., including purchasers of Apple Inc. call options and sellers of Apple Inc. put options, during the period from November 2, 2018, through January 2, 2019, inclusive.""
3. Q\_ How much money do I get per share? - The average payout will be $1.33 per share, but usually only 25% of investors file claims, so in this case it would be 4x more.
4. Q\_ Lawyers will get all the money for this I won't get anything at the end of the day. - Lawyers already are getting paid, you'll lose only the money that you don't claim.

Looks like a sell trapt...institutions playing retail players like a childplay fools.,18,lrhcj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/lrhcj1/looks_like_a_sell_traptinstitutions_playing/,22,2021-02-24 17:50:03,"IMO:

Institutions are getting shares from the little retail players for cheap as retailers continue to sell thinking aapl will drop to $100-$110 range based on articles they read and talking heads media. 🤔

Articles that said they are shorting Apple are for morons to believe in. 🙄 pro traders don't short Apple cuz there're much more better and safer short stocks out there to profit from.

10 year bond yields rising and sectors rotation are over played and priced in so much already. Although rising B-yields are not good for tech sector (mainly riskier small to mid cap stocks) but not too much so for Apple. The real B-yield is minus inflation # is still equal to negative b-yields, meaning equity, growth stocks with dividends like Apple, is still and will continue to be more attractive to institutions even when they rotating to rebalance their portfolios.

Many Amateurs options players will continue to get burned 🔥 with their random lucks and trends speculations for a short time periods; while traders and longs in aapl ""SHARES"" continue to profits ""consistently"" both long and short terms in aapl!

Aapl shares traders are at least 90% to always never get a loss trade...mostly profitable year by year!!!

Invest/buy/accumulate aapl at these levels today with absolute confidence!

Up vote this post, share the info...retail players ""together"" equal more knowledgeables and profitables. Separated equal getting pick apart by institutions players."

scenario 1.) when big boys take a certain profits from a single company to balance their portfolios -- it's a good bullish thing! They're still keeping their large remaining $hares and let it ri$e in long term.

scenario 2.) when big boys willing to sell most of their shares at a loss (like you amateurs options players) in a company, it's because they see a crack in its fundamentals -- it's bearish and time to dump your shares and run for the hill!

aapl is scenario 1!!!

AAPL valuation trends,17,sb7y71,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/sb7y71/aapl_valuation_trends/,18,2022-01-24 01:04:34,"AAPL is my favorite **defensive** stock for growth.  Since 2011 they have grown market share in PC sales (laptops & desktops) from 10.5% to 13+% while maintaining their premium pricing model IN SPITE of Intel and MSFT's Windows 10/Windows 11 efforts.  

(link:) [https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-share-apple/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-share-apple/)

Yup, iPhones are their biggest moneymaker, but Macs and services (Apple TV, App Store, Apple Music etc) and ""other"" (Apple watch, Beats headphones, AirPods, plus whatever else they're working on).

So even if the market dips, my wager is that AAPL will dip LESS that the average tech stock.  They understand how to nurture R&D and flow it into products.  While Cook may be a less charismatic company manager than Jobs, he has done a good job of infusing growth into the corporate R&D and engineering culture.

I encourage discussion."
Why I invest in Apple,18,roisec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/roisec/why_i_invest_in_apple/,18,2021-12-25 23:21:36,"Was talking with my friends earlier in the week and one of my friends who was always an android user told me he bought an iPhone. He said that he uses it as his phone for picking up girls. Apparently, lots of (younger) girls view green text as a turnoff. 

I thought it was nonsense at first but I asked around. Apparently it's at least somewhat true. I don't think that this is a reflection of how most Gen z females think at all, but the fact that there's so many people out there that view iPhone and Apple products as status symbols just means one thing: 💵💵.

Frankly I think these people are pompous, ignorant pricks but I love it. Apple has created a lifestyle with a cult like following. Not just an iPhone or an iPad. A lifestyle."

"Apple Gaining China Market Share Amid iPhone Shipments Surge, Says Morgan Stanley",16,p8ddx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/p8ddx2/apple_gaining_china_market_share_amid_iphone/,14,2021-08-20 21:34:14,"8/18/2021

Apple (AAPL) is winning market share in China, with iPhone shipments in the country up 79% year-over-year in July versus 27% for Chinese smartphone vendors, Morgan Stanley said Wednesday in a research note citing data from China's Academy for Information and Communications Technology.

Apple's July gain is a big improvement from Q2, when iPhone shipments in China declined 4% from a year earlier, said Morgan Stanley analysts including Katy Huberty.

The iPhone gained 90 basis points of installed base share in China year-over-year, ending July at a 27-month-high of nearly 21%, Morgan Stanley said, citing data from third-party vendor Jiguang.

The older iPhone 11 models make up more than 21% of Apple's installed base in China despite the popularity of the newer iPhone 12 models, Morgan Stanley noted. ""These data points support our view that the iPhone can see continued shipment strength after the launch of the new iPhone 13 model in September/October,"" the analysts said."

Looking forward to this weeks market and the future iPhone!

Apple is just an amazing company when it comes to creating, marketing, and selling digital electronic consumer products! 

Many great reasons to own and hold the stock from inflationary pressures to cash flow or dividends of this high speed train. New rumored products like i glasses or icar. Finances that are commandeering with other consumerable services. 

Long and strong for multiple years!"
